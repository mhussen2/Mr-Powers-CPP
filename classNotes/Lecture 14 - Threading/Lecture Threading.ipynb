    "# Threading\n",
    " Threading is the ability to have python perform one or more function at the same time independently from the rest of the program. \n",
    " Python threads are OS threads therefore they run cooperatively (runs in a way that involves mutual assistance in working towards a common goal).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Well understood so easy to implement\n",
    "- Increase speed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "- not designed for CPU intensive tasks\n",
    "    - due to the cooperative nature of the tasks the CPU will need to pause the runtime to switch to another tread that is a higher priority then return to the python task. \n",
    "- The programer is responsible for managing states between treads.\n",
    "    - Think performing actions on the data being processed in the treads. Ie saving the object after the threads run. "
