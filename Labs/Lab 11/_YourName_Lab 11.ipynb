    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to understand a large dataset of 27901 rows and 18 columns Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data. Look at how the data effects the end result **depression** (yes/no)\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "- Load and get a basic understanding of the dataset\n",
    "- Clean up the data \n",
    "    - examples:\n",
    "        - check and fix any missing data \n",
    "        - use both Hot and integer encoding\n",
    "        - convert any numeric data from strings to ints\n",
    "- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \n",
    "    - I will leave it to you to understand and explore this. \n",
    "        - Histplot\n",
    "        - Countplot\n",
    "        - Correlation\n",
    "        - Heatmaps\n",
    "        - boxplots\n",
    "        - have fun\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to communicate to me along the way. I want your to tell me what your assumptions are what your learning about the data and what you learned with EDA.  There are 18 data points for each student I expect an perform EDA on most of those points like what we did in class with MPG. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Remember*** how we did a `sns.pairplot(df[[ \"cylinders\", \"mpg\",\"model_year\"]])` and `sns.pairplot(df[[\"mpg\", \"horsepower\", \"weight\", \"displacement\"]])` \n",

    "Model the data using what we learned in `Linear_Regression_Part2.ipynb` predict if a student will or will not have `Depression` \n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform linear Regression on the model using `DecisionTreeRegressor`\n",
    "- Have at least 5 different models and how dropping a column effects the data predictor \n",
    "- Once you find a model with a good prediction play with the size of your test and training data to understand how it affects your model\n",
