    "- Load and get a basic understanding of the dataset\n",
    "- Clean up the data \n",
    "    - examples:\n",
    "        - check and fix any missing data \n",
    "        - use both Hot and integer encoding\n",
    "        - convert any numeric data from strings to ints\n",
    "- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \n",

    "Make sure to communicate to me along the way. I want your to tell me what your assumptions are what your learning about the data and what you learned with EDA.  There are 18 data points for each student I expect an perform EDA on most of those points like what we did in class with MPG. (remember how we did a sns.pairplot(df[[ \"cylinders\", \"mpg\",\"model_year\"]]) and sns.pairplot(df[[\"mpg\", \"horsepower\", \"weight\", \"displacement\"]]) and others. ) \n",
